# File-Encryption-and-Decryption-tool-using-Python-
File Encryption and Decryption Tool Using Python is a simple yet effective command-line utility designed to help users securely encrypt and decrypt files using strong cryptographic algorithms provided by the Python cryptography library. This tool allows you to generate a unique encryption key, encrypt any file to protect its contents from unauthorized access, and later decrypt it back to its original form using the same key. It is easy to use, cross-platform, and ideal for anyone who needs to safeguard sensitive data on their system. To get started, simply install the required dependencies, generate a key, and use straightforward commands to encrypt or decrypt your files. Remember to keep your key file safe, as losing it means you won't be able to recover your encrypted data.
